#Can I Run These Scrips On Any Clients
yes you can here is how
```
```md
#IDKR client
you must first right click the shortcut on your desktop and choose properties
next in the Target Box at the very end after " this character put a space then paste this 
--disable-web-security
hit apply then ok.
now you need to run the client and turn on user script in the IDKR section of your Krunker Settings
then lose the client. This act will create a idkr folder in your Documents folder.
you now need to download a script (1 at a time is all that will work for these menus)
and then place this script in the idkr/scripts folder.
You may now start up the client and your mod will load.

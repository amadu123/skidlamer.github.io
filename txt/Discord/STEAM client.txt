#STEAM Client
for the steam client we need to inject our scripts at runtime so first if you have the steam krunker open close it.
then Download a bat file from my github (again one at a time.
put this on your desktop. Now when you want to run mods run this bat.
It will launch the steam client then inject the script at runtime
